  abstract   = {Intermarriage is often seen as a solvent of caste and ethnic divisions. This study provides the first nationwide analysis of intermarriage in Nepal, drawing on data from the 2001 and 2011 censuses. Despite Nepal’s remarkable diversity, intermarriage remains exceedingly rare, comprising only 0.74\% of all marriages. Only Madhesi Brahman/Chhetri, Newar, and MPB (Marwadi, Punjabi, Bangali) communities surpass 1\%. Log-linear models reveal persistent, though weakening, intergroup boundaries, with indigenous Janajatis exhibiting greater openness. Gender asymmetries—such as lower-caste men marrying into higher-caste groups—are evident. Education most effectively facilitates intermarriage for women from disadvantaged groups (e.g., Dalits, Janajatis) but has limited or even negative effects among privileged groups. Child marriage, still present in nearly half of all unions, reinforces caste endogamy, especially among Dalits. However, unexpectedly higher intermarriage rates in child marriages among privileged communities suggest strategic out-marriages. These findings highlight the enduring resilience of caste and ethnic divisions in Nepal, while identifying educational expansion and enforcement of minimum marriage age, especially targeting disadvantaged populations, as promising pathways toward social integration. These insights carry important implications for policies aimed at reducing caste- and ethnicity-based stratification in Nepal and similarly divided societies.},
